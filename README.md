# CodeChallenge
This Repo contains two functions
  1) To sort an array by odd numbers and even numbers which by themselves are sorted
     For example [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] will be sorted as [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8].
  2) Permutations of given array
     For example [a, b] will produce [a, b] [b, a] as result.

The repo also has jest enable.
